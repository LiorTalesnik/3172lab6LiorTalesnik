## IMPORTANT NOTES

So for this lab I focused a lot on trying my best to get most functions working. 
Now I do have a working backend to display my current projects. Although I was not able to 
fully be able to figure out the API part, I tryed multiple times and after sometime I decided 
to remove it completly since it was cuase a lot of issue and problems. also the dark and light mode 
button is not in a fully functional state but it meets most of the requirments like storing it in local 
storage.
